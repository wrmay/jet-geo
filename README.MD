# Overview

The purpose of this project is to accelerate the set up of Hazelcast projects.   It is intended to be used
as a starting point. It consists of a 2 member Hazelcast 3.12 cluster , a Hazelcast client and Hazelcast
Management Center, deployed together using docker-compose.

The Maven groupId and artifactId can be customized, as well as the base
java package name.

To create a project using this template, install [tplate](https://pypi.org/project/tplate) then ...

```
tplate https://github.com/wrmay/hazelcast-starter path/to/my-project-dir
```

The artifact id will be the final part of the second argument you pass ("my-project-dir" in the example).
You will be prompted for the maven group id and the java package name.
